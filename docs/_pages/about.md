I am a DPhil student in the [Foster Lab](https://zoo-kfoster.zoo.ox.ac.uk), Department of Biochemistry (Zoology), at the University of Oxford. I am on the [Interdisciplinary Bioscience DTP](https://www.biodtp.ox.ac.uk) programme (2018-22), funded by the UKRI BBSRC, at Magdalen College. 

Previously, I studied Biological Sciences at Somerville College, University of Oxford, and obtained a BA (Hons).


## Research interests

I am interested in the multispecies microbial community that forms the gut microbiota and how it can protect us against pathogens. My experimental work focuses on two key questions. First, the ecology of the gut microbiota: how do commensal species interact with invading pathogens and can probiotic communities be engineered to inhibit them? Second, how do these probiotic communities and pathogens evolve over time? I use *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* as model pathogens in my research, and carry out experiments in vitro and in vivo.
